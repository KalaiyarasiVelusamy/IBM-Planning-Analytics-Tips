To delete files older than 180 days in a TM1 TurboIntegrator (TI) process, 
you can use the ExecuteCommand function in combination with a shell command that finds and deletes such files. 
Below is a step-by-step guide on how to implement this.


TI process code for reference:
# Define the directory containing the files
vDirectory = 'C:\path\to\your\directory';  # Change this to your target directory

# Define the command to find and delete files older than 180 days
vCommand = 'forfiles /p "' | vDirectory | '" /s /m *.* /d -180 /c "cmd /c del @path"';

# Execute the command
ExecuteCommand(vCommand, 1);

# Optional logging for confirmation
AsciiOutput('DeleteOldFilesLog.txt', 'Files older than 180 days deleted from:', vDirectory);
