The customer requested identifying the term "FTE" within the available Dimensions. 
Initially, a WHILE loop was used to search through all dimensions, but this approach was slow due to the large number of dimensions. 
We then optimized the process by creating an MDX subset that filters by pattern. 
If the subset contains results, the dimension name is extracted into the output file, allowing for faster completion of the task.
