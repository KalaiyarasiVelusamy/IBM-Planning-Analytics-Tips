To maintain cell security in TM1:

Set up a standalone cube that includes dimensions for version, year, month, group, and measures.
Define the type of access each group should have.
Create a cell security cube for every cube that requires security settings.
    TI process to create the cell security cube, refer the object - "sys_CellSecurityCube_Create"
Apply security to each cube by referencing the standalone cube through rules.
This approach allows for centralized management of security settings across all cubes, simplifying maintenance.

Refer the below rule to be applied in the newly created }cellsecuritycubes.
 []=S:Cellgets(DB('sysSecurityAssignment',!Version,!Year,!months,!SysGroup,'SecurityAssign'));
