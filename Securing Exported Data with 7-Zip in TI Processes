In TM1 TurboIntegrator (TI) processes, there’s no native support to zip files with password protection directly. 
However, you can achieve this by using command line utilities such as 7-Zip or WinRAR in combination with a TI process.

Below is a step-by-step guide using 7-Zip, which is free and widely used:

Prerequisites
1. Install 7-Zip: Download and install 7-Zip, and ensure it’s accessible in your system path or specify the full path to the 7z.exe executable in the TI script.
2. Determine File Paths: Make sure to know the location of the file to be zipped and the destination where the zipped file should be stored.


Below TI process code for reference:-
# Define the file path and name variables
vExportFile = 'C:\path\to\exportfile.csv';    # Path to the export file
vZipFile = 'C:\path\to\exportfile.zip';       # Path to the output zip file
vPassword = 'YourPasswordHere';               # Password for the zip file

# Define the 7-Zip command to zip with a password
# Adjust the path to 7z.exe if necessary
vCommand = '"C:\Program Files\7-Zip\7z.exe" a -p' | vPassword | ' ' | vZipFile | ' ' | vExportFile;

# Execute the command
ExecuteCommand(vCommand, 1);

# Optional logging for confirmation
AsciiOutput('ZipProcessLog.txt', 'File zipped successfully:', vZipFile, 'with password.');
