Customer requests to identify the word FTE in the list of available Dimensions. 
Data source has been set as list of all dimensions. 
Initially the process was designed to be executed using WHILE loop to search for the key word "FTE".
As the dimensions are large in number, it was taking forever to complete the execution.
Then we modified the process to create a MDX subset which filters by pattern.
If the subset is non empty then that dimension name is extracted in the output file.
By this way we can quickly completed the task.
